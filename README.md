# About

This mod adds a functional RPG specialization and skill system into Minecraft.

# Notice

This mod is for `Forge` only!

This mod is still **work-in-progress**!

# Features

You can choose one of 3 specializations for your first after you reach a certain experience level. `5 by default`

You can unlock all specializations later down the line by spending your experience levels `30 by default`

Each specialization gives bonus XP and has 6 skills which you can level up by spending your available experience.

A list of all specializations and skills can be found [here](https://github.com/Darkorg69/Better-Leveling/wiki/Specializations-&-Skills).

# Important!

The default key for opening the GUI is `B`.  
You can always change it from the keybindings menu.

Please, back up your worlds when you update the game or the mod.  
In case you don't back up your world data loss or world corruption could occur.

# Media

After reaching level 5, press `B` and choose your first specialization.
